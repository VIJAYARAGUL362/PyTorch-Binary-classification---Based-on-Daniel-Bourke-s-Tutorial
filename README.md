![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84871383-2514-4c5f-9be7-f704dbb439c2)

This repository contains hands-on code exercises and practical implementations developed while actively following Daniel Bourke's excellent ["Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxhpLp5vsX2CmK1lbC_5qvj1SjW5B2vjX) YouTube tutorial series.

It serves as a tangible demonstration of my foundational skills in building, training, and evaluating neural networks using the PyTorch library.

### ðŸ§  Skills Demonstrated:

This project showcases practical experience in:

* **Deep Learning Fundamentals:** Understanding core concepts of neural networks.
* **PyTorch Framework:** Implementing models and training loops using `torch` and `torch.nn`.
* **Neural Network Architecture:** Designing and implementing simple linear and sequential models.
* **Training Workflow:** Implementing the standard forward pass, loss calculation, backward pass, and optimizer steps.
* **Loss Functions:** Applying `BCEWithLogitsLoss` (Binary Classification) and `L1Loss` (Regression).
* **Optimizers:** Using `torch.optim.SGD` for model weight updates.
* **Data Handling:** Loading/converting data (NumPy to PyTorch Tensors), splitting datasets (`sklearn.model_selection`), and preparing data for models.
* **Task Implementation:** Building models for both **Binary Classification** and Linear Regression problems.
* **Handling Non-linear Data:** Understanding the need for and implementing **Activation Functions (ReLU)** to enable models to learn complex patterns (demonstrated on the circles dataset).
* **Model Evaluation:** Calculating metrics (like accuracy) and tracking training/testing loss.
* **Data Visualization:** Using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to visualize datasets, training progress (loss curves), and model performance (decision boundaries, predictions).
* **Code Structure:** Organizing code using classes (`nn.Module`) and functions.
* **Device Agnosticism:** Writing code compatible with both CPU and GPU.
* **Learning Initiative:** Demonstrating the ability to learn complex technical topics from online resources and apply them through coding.

### âœ¨ Project Highlights:

* Built and trained a linear model on a non-linear classification dataset to illustrate limitations.
* Developed and trained a non-linear model using ReLU to effectively classify the challenging "circles" dataset.
* Implemented a linear regression model to fit a simple linear dataset.
* Visualized the decision boundaries learned by classification models and the predictions made by the regression model.
* Tracked and plotted training and testing loss over epochs to monitor learning progress.
